# NaClShuttle
This repository includes the working proof of concept of NaClShuttle, a minimal VPN using TweetNaCl for encryption. This work is created as part of a bachelor thesis research for [Radboud University](https://ru.nl/) (Nijmegen, The Netherlands), supervised by [Dr. Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org).

# Usage
For details on how to use NaClShuttle, read the [full bachelor thesis](https://www.cs.ru.nl/bachelors-theses/2017/Stan_Derksen___4386388___Creating-a-secure-virtual-private-network-using-minimal-code.pdf). NaClShuttle is currently only tested on an ethernet connection.
